# TODO
- color the TRN section based on the active player so concede is obvious
- consider writing media queries for smaller screens

### Done
- ~~logic for concede~~
- ~~notifications for winning, resetting, forfeteing rounds and so on~~
- ~~hover states for footer buttons~~
- ~~state should be: game state / player win state~~
- ~~method for resetting the ROUND and resetting the whole game~~
- ~~for each 'round' only reset the round (aka board) state~~
  - ~~only on button click do we reset the entire game~~
- ~~Parse out player score into~~:
  - ~~single digit gets a leading zero (special styling)~~
  - ~~double digit prints normal~~
- ~~when a game is won, highlight the affected items, and then reset it~~
- ~~component to server as a digit display (01 vs 11). player scores and round meta use it~~

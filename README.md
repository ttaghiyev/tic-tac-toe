Started as a curiosity about react setState debate, once the code logic was put to rest I decided to finish out the game and give it a touch of modern gaming design styling.

## Install / Launch

Don't have yarn?

`npm install -g yarn`

Have yarn?

`yarn install`

Curious about tests?

`yarn test`

Nope, I just wanna play...

`yarn start` â€” game is at <http://localhost:8080>
